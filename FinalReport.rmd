# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

Is attitude toward capitol punishment (cappun) independent of race (race)?
If not, then whose view differs from whom??

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->
In this variable analysis we will be using graphical, Numerical, and inferential results to figure out what we will be doing and getting better info.
# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->

```{r}
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata)
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata, type="percent")

```

In this plot it shows me that there about 400 white people for capital punishment and about 200 white people who are against capital punishment, about 50 black people who are for capital punishment and about 60 black people who against capital punishment or we could say about 65% of white people are for it and about 30% of white people who are against it, about 45% of black people who are for it and about 50% of black people who are against it.

## Now with LESS data (more variables give less data due to NA's) create the approate graphic displays to answer the question.





### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->
```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~race + cappun, data=mydata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
My Numerical results show that there are 68% of white people are for it and 32% who are against it,for black people there are 47% who are in favor and 53% of black people who are opposed it,and for others there are 61% that are in favor and 39% of others who are against it.




## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```
The p value is 2.2 percent and we can't figure it out unless we use the other inferentail test to get the exact value.
```{r}
fisherXY(mydata$race,mydata$cappun, printAll= TRUE)
```
The second fisher test shows us that using lesser data we get that we are truly just seeing the data for black and white. The odds ratio is 0.5681142 and we get a 95 percent confidence interval and we just see that the p value of the data is 0.06299.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
In this branch we have less data then in the first one so we will get a different out come.There are a lot of white people who are in favor of capital punishment then any other race black people are kind of half and half but most don't want capital punishment.My Numerical results show that there are 79% of white people are in favor black people are 11% are in favor and others are 9% in favor.There are only 66% of white people who oppose black people are 22 % and others are 10 percent.The p value is 2.2 percent and we can't figure it out unless we use the other inferential test to get the exact value.The second fisher test shows us that using lesser data we get that we are truly just seeing the data for black and white. The odds ratio is 0.5681142 and we get a 95 percent confidence interval and we just see that the p value of the data is 0.06299.
